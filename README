HandlerTest
===========

This program send commands to a card through the reader.

The card must implement the test application. The application is
provided as a JavaCard applet.

The tester dynamically load the driver. pcscd must be stopped (unless
you know what you do) to avoid interferences with the drivers/readers
already used by pcscd.

The tester will only find and use the first USB reader found by the
reader. If you have multiple readers managed by the same driver you must
test them one after the other.

Tested commands:
================

Case 1, APDU:
Cmd  = CLA INS P1 P2
L(Cmd) = 4

Case 1, TPDU:
Cmd  = CLA INS P1 P2 P3 (=0)
L(Cmd) = 5

Case 2:
Cmd  = CLA INS P1 P2 Le
L(Cmd) = 5
-> No difference between TPDU and APDU (T=0)

Case 3:
Cmd  = CLA INS P1 P2 Lc Data
L(Cmd) = 5 + Lc
-> No difference between TPDU and APDU (T=0)   

Case 4, APDU:
Cmd  = CLA INS P1 P2 Lc Data Le
L(Cmd) = 5 + Lc +1

Case 4, TPDU:
Cmd  = CLA INS P1 P2 Lc Data
L(Cmd) = 5 + Lc
-> TPDU, treat as Case 3 and return 61 xx, and perform GET RESPONSE

Time Request
This is not a command per se but the card will send time requests (0x60)
to the reader.
